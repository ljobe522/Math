### Lesson Content

> [!TIP]- Describe Specific Instructions
> Be specific about your instructions. Make sure the rules are clear and concise:
> ---
> > 1. Everyone in the group must contribute
> > 2. Conversations with other groups should not be taking place
> > 3. I will give directions as we go. Please be listening for further instructions

#### Discovery

> You have been given a coordinate plane on your board with two shapes

> Your job is to determine if they are congruent using transformations. 

> Remember, rigid transformations mean that the shape does not change in anyway.

#### Formalize

How do we calculate [[Glossary of Terms#Transformations|Transformations]]?

---

Translations:
>Shape
---

Reflections:
>Position
---

Rotations
>NOT the size
---


>[!NOTE]- Extension
> What if we wanted to do multiple transformations at once? How would we apply our formulas?\
> If a formula is a [[Glossary of Terms#Function|Function]] how can we put one function into another function?

---

#### Transformations on the coordinate plane

> What happens to coordinates when they undergo transformations?

>Work at your table with your groups to calculate the new coordinates of a shape after a series of transformations. Try to do this without drawing the figure.

---

> Students use dry erase markers to calculate coordinates.

---

Think Pair Share

---

Think:
> How do my coordinates change between each transformation?
> What are the coordinates of my final image?

---

Pair:
> What did your group come up with?
> How does one transformation affect the next one?

---

Share:
> What did you find?
> What were your ending coordinates?
> How did you calculate that?

---

Practice and Apply

> Individual Work: Delta Math

---

Take-a-ways:
> Transformations change a pre-image into an image.
> Transformations can be calculated and predicted with or without a visual. 
> Formulas can be combined to calculate multiple transformations at once.

### Follow-up

> [!EXAMPLE]- Enrichment

> [!EXAMPLE]- Reinforcement

> [!EXAMPLE]- Remediation

### Grouping

Students are assigned semi-permanent groups (changed regularly) based on the following criteria in this order of priority:
1.    Roster order sorted by S1 grade.
2.    Personality/behavior

Students have been assigned groups of 2-3 people. If a group is missing 1 or 2 people, it may be combined with another group to create a group of up to 3 people.

Students will be instructed to take the roles of:
·         Scribe (writes on the board)
·         Crier (describes what is on the board)
·         Sage (facilitates the conversation and provides insight)

These roles will rotate regularly during the group work phase, and are also used at student tables to define roles for think-pair-share activities.

# Unit 7 - Congruence

## M1.G.CO.A.1
Know precise definitions of angle, circle, perpendicular line, parallel line, and line segment, based on the undefined notions of point, line, plane, distance along a line, and distance around a circular arc.

## M1.G.CO.A.2
Represent transformations in the plane in multiple ways, including technology. Describe transformations as functions that take points in the plane (pre-image) as inputs and give other points (image) as outputs. Compare transformations that preserve distance and angle measure to those that do not (e.g., translation versus horizontal stretch).

## M1.G.CO.A.3
Given a rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid, or regular polygon, describe the rotations and reflections that carry the shape onto itself.

## M1.G.CO.A.4
Develop definitions of rotations, reflections, and translations in terms of angles, circles, perpendicular lines, parallel lines, and line segments.

## M1.G.CO.A.5
Given a geometric figure and a rigid motion, draw the image of the figure in multiple ways, including technology. Specify a sequence of rigid motions that will carry a given figure onto another.

## M1.G.CO.B.6
Use geometric descriptions of rigid motions to transform figures and to predict the effect of a given rigid motion on a given figure; given two figures, use the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions to determine informally if they are congruent.

## M1.G.CO.B.7
Use the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions to show that two triangles are congruent if and only if corresponding pairs of sides and corresponding pairs of angles are congruent.

## M1.G.CO.B.8

**Explain how the criteria for triangle congruence (ASA, SAS, AAS, and SSS) follow from the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions.**

**Guarantee:Essential Task**
I can..

Identify corresponding parts in two triangles.
Determine which combinations of congruent corresponding parts must be known to verify that two triangles are congruent.**

# Unit 8 - Angles, Parallel Lines, Triangles, Parallelograms

## M1.G.CO.C.9
Prove theorems about lines (including parallel lines) and angles. •Vertical Angles•Alternate interior angles and corresponding angles are congruent•Points on a perpendicular bisector are exactly those equidistant from the segment’s endpoints.

## M1.G.CO.C.10
Prove theorems about triangles•Interior angles sum to 180°•Base angles of isosceles triangles are congruent•Segment joining midpoints of two sides is parallel to the third side and half the length•The medians of a triangle meet at a point

## M1.G.CO.C.11
Prove theorems about parallelograms.•Opposite sides are congruent•Opposite angles are congruent•The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other(using triangle congruence)•Rectangles are parallelograms with congruent diagonals

# Unit 9 - One-Variable Statistics

## M1.S.ID.A.1
Represent single or multiple data sets with dot plots, histograms, stemplots(stem and leaf), and box plots.

## M1.S.ID.A.2
Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution to compare center (median, mean) and spread (interquartile range, standard deviation) of two or more different data sets.

## M1.S.ID.A.3
Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers)

# IM2 - Unit 2 - Quadratics

Multiply two linear functions graphically to produce a quadratic

## M2.F.IF.A.1
For a function that models a relationship between two quantities, interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description of the relationship. ★Essential TaskGuarantee:•I can find intercepts of quadratic functions.•I can find the relative maximums/minimums of a quadratic function.Key features include: intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums and minimums; symmetries; and end behavior(informally).Introduce Three Forms: vertex, factored, and standard

## M2.F.BF.B.2
Identify the effect on the graph of replacing f(x) by f(x) + k, k f(x), and f(x + k) for specific values of k (both positive and negative); find the value of k given the graphs.

## M2.A.APR.A.1
Understand that polynomials form a system analogous to the integers, namely, they are closed under the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication; add, subtract, and multiply polynomials.Essential TaskGuarantee:•I can add, subtract and multiply polynomials

## M2.A.SSE.B.3a
Choose and produce an equivalent form of an expression to reveal and explain properties of the quantity represented by the expression (Zeroes).* Essential TasksGuarantee:I can factor a quadratic expression(limited to leading coefficient of 1)

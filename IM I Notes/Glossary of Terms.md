# Transformation
A change in the size, position, or orientation of a figure

# Rigid Transformation
A change in the position of a figure without changing the figure's size or shape. Mathematically speaking, Rigid Transformations are movements that preserve angle measures and distances between points.

# Translation
The process of moving an object a specific distance without changing its size or shape

# Pre-Image
The initial shape and position of an object to undergo a transformation. Noted by capital letters. 

# Image
The shape and position resulting from an object undergoing a transformation. Noted by capital letters with the "prime" mark: ABC -> A'B'C'

# Corresponding Sides
The sides with the same name between two images

# Corresponding Angles
The angles with the same name and measurement between two objects

# Congruent
Two figures having the same size and angles

# Theorem
A statement that can be proven true using definitions, postulates, or other theorems

# Postulate
A mathematical statement that cannot be proven but is considered true

# Side-Side-Side Congruence Theorem
If three sides of one triangle are equal to the corresponding side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent

# Side-Angle-Side Congruence Theorem
If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding sides and the included angle of the second triangle, then the triangles are congruent

# Angle-Side-Angle Congruence Theorem
If two angles and the included side of one triangle are congruent to two angles and the included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent

# Angle-Angle-Side Congruence Theorem
If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding angles and the corresponding non-included side of the second triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

# Hypotenuse-Leg Congruence Theorem
If the hypotenuse and a leg of a right triangle are congruent to the corresponding hypotenuse and leg of the second right triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
